Your privacy is critically important to me. Your data is your own. I make no claims to it and will only use it according to the policies outlined below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

GFree Ingredients allows you to check the gluten status of individual food ingredients. This data is not transmitted outside of the app.

If GFree Ingredients, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that GFree Ingredients goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of GFree Ingredients may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
