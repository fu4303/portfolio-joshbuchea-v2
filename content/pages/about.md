Hi, my name is Josh Buchea ðŸ‘‹ I live near Portland, Oregon with my wife and two daughters.
I'm originally from McMinnville, Oregon.
I studied Website Development and Design and Computer Information Systems at Portland Community College.

My career in tech has led me from engineering front-end web to full-stack web to mobile.
I currently work at [Echobind][],
