Preheat oven to 450 degrees

- 1 1/4 cup of warm water
- 2 tsp instant yeast

Add warm water to a bowl. Add yeast to the water and give a little stir. Let sit for 5-10 min, it should start to foam and active. If nothing happens, throw out and start again.

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 1/2 cups of flour (maybe a little more)

Add oil, salt, and flour to yeast and water. Using a rubber spatula, gently start mixing together. Once a dough ball has formed, lose the spatula and start kneading (in the bowl) with palms and keeping it in a ball form. Once you have kneaded for about 5 min and no flour remains in the bowl, leave ball in bowl and cover with cling wrap for 30-45 min

Once ball is double in size, rip it in two or four pieces. On a lightly floured surface knead dough a little and start rolling it with a rolling pin. I rolled into a rectangle for cooking sheets, but after you roll it you can cut it to a circle for a pizza pan. Roll it to a desired thickness (1/8” for me), making sure it’s even everywhere. Place onto cooking sheet. Do the same with remaining dough.

- 1 cup marinara sauce
- 2 cups Mexican shredded cheese
- Toppings: pepperoni, olives, onions, peppers, sausage, ground beef, etc.

Assembly: take first sheet of dough. Divide topping ingredients by 2 or 4 depending on how many pizza doughs you made. I made 2 so here’s mine:

- 1/2 cup marinara
- 1 cup cheese
- Single layer of pepperoni
- Topped with olives and onions

You can top it again with a bit of cheese.

Bake at 450 for 13 min (I am at sea level, so make sure you know if you need to adjust time or temp) while you assemble the next.  Pizza should be nice golden brown on the underside.

Enjoy!
